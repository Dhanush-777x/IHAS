        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">What is Dengue?</h2>
        <p>Dengue is a viral disease. It is transmitted by the infective bite of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. These mosquitoes also spread Zika, Chikungunya, and other diseases. Man develops disease after 5-6 days of being bitten by an infective mosquito. Infected person with Dengue becomes infective to mosquitoes 6 to 12 hours before the onset of the disease and remains so up to 3 to 5 days.</p>
        <p>Dengue is caused by one of any of four related viruses: Dengue virus 1, 2, 3, and 4. A person can be infected with dengue multiple times in their life.</p>
        <p>It occurs in two forms:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>Dengue Fever: is a flu-like illness</li>
          <li>Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF): is a more severe form of disease, which may cause death</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Person suspected of having dengue fever or DHF must attend the nearest medical facility.</p>
        <p>Almost half of the worldâ€™s population, about 4 billion people, live in areas with a risk of dengue. Dengue is often a leading cause of illness in areas with risk. Each year, up to 400 million people are infected by a dengue virus. Approximately 100 million people get sick from infection, and 40,000 die from severe dengue.</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Preventive Measures:</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal ml-8">
          <li>Personal Prophylactic Measures: Use of mosquito repellent creams, liquids, coils, mats etc. Wearing of full sleeve shirts and full pants with socks. Use of bed nets for sleeping infants and young children during day time to prevent mosquito bite.</li>
          <li>Biological Control: Use of larvivorous fishes in ornamental tanks, fountains, etc.</li>
          <li>Chemical Control: Use of chemical larvicides like Temephos 50% EC in big water holdings. Aerosol space spray during day time in and around the houses, market places, large campuses and buildings using Pyrethrum 2% Extract.</li>
          <li>Environmental Management & Source Reduction Methods:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
              <li>Identification and destruction of mosquito breeding sources</li>
              <li>Management of roof tops, porticos and sunshades</li>
              <li>The water storing containers should be scrubbed and washed with bleaching powder every week.</li>
              <li>They should be properly covered with a cloth or sheet so as to prevent mosquito breeding in the water containers.</li>
              <li>Reliable water supply</li>
              <li>Observation of weekly dry day</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Health Education: Impart knowledge to common people regarding the disease and vector through various media sources like T.V., Radio, Cinema slides, etc.</li>
          <li>Community Participation: Sensitizing and involving the community for detection of Aedes breeding places and their elimination.</li>
        </ol>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Risk Factors of Dengue</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>Mosquito Exposure: Being in areas where mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus are present increases the risk.</li>
          <li>Travel: Traveling to regions where dengue is endemic or epidemic exposes individuals to the virus.</li>
          <li>Lack of Vector Control: Poor mosquito control measures in urban or rural areas can lead to higher mosquito populations and thus increase the risk of dengue transmission.</li>
          <li>Standing Water: Accumulation of stagnant water in containers or areas around homes provides breeding grounds for mosquitoes that transmit the virus.</li>
          <li>Climate Factors: Weather conditions such as heavy rainfall followed by periods of drought can create environments conducive to mosquito breeding and dengue transmission.</li>
          <li>Poor Sanitation: Inadequate waste management and sanitation practices can contribute to the proliferation of mosquitoes.</li>
          <li>Individual Susceptibility: Factors such as age, immunity, and overall health status can influence an individual's susceptibility to dengue infection.</li>
